# budgets

This repository contains notebooks and data for the Swedish government budget and the budgets of the opposition parties.

## Notes
- Instead of HTML tables, the budget from Centerpartiet is included as a series of images. To get around this, we search for the individual budget item motions and piece them together. Note that a few budget areas are missing.
- The Excel version of the government's budget proposal has been manually annotated with identifiying digits to facilitate merging on the three-level hierarchical index it's made up of.
